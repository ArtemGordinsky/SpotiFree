# SpotiFree
SpotiFree is a tiny simple **AppleScript** script, that automatically detects and mutes Spotify ads on OS X.

## How it works
SpotiFree is polling Spotify every **0.5** seconds to see if current track has **0** popularity and is  **less then 40 seconds long**. If it is, Spotify is paused, its volume is set to **0** and the playback is restored. When an ad is over, the volume is set to the way it was set before.

## Installing
1. Place SpotiFree in an **Applications** folder
2. Open **SpotiFree** from your **Applications** folder
3. *(autorun)* Find its icon in the Dock and go into contectual menu and select *Options â†’ Open at login* to run at login
4. *(hiding the Dock icon)* Open **Terminal**, and run *defaults write /Applications/SpotiFree.app/Contents/Info LSUIElement 1*

## Origin
SpotiFree is based on the code I've [found](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=16033608) on MacRumors forums.
